# cellular-automata-animator
A Java program that can animate simple Wolfram CA rules, and Conway's Game of Life. 

Run the driver class which should open a GUI. Note: this is not ideal, but to animate a simple CA rule in the top section, you first need to click "Save rule". This will be updated in a future version.
